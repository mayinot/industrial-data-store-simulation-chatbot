    "Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and understanding natural language, but they need a way to access your enterprise data to be truly helpful.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've built a complete natural language interface for querying a Manufacturing Execution System. This approach allows anyone in your organization to access manufacturing data without needing to understand SQL or database schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key learnings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Foundation Model Integration**: We used Amazon Bedrock's Converse API to connect foundation models to industrial data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Use Pattern**: We implemented a tool use pattern that allows the model to:\n",
    "   - Retrieve database schema information\n",
    "   - Generate and execute SQL queries\n",
    "   - Process the results into natural language responses\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Flexibility**: The Converse API allows us to easily switch between different models without changing our application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **End-to-End Solution**: We built a complete chatbot that takes a question and returns a clear, informative answer based on up-to-date manufacturing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern can be extended to other industrial data stores, including:\n",
    "- Other MES systems\n",
    "- ERP systems\n",
    "- SCADA systems\n",
    "- Data historians\n",
    "- Industrial IoT platforms\n",
    "- Custom manufacturing databases\n",
    "\n",
    "By making industrial data more accessible through natural language interfaces, you can democratize data access across your organization and enable more data-driven decision making at all levels."

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy a more user-friendly interface for this MES chatbot, we've created a simple Streamlit application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "streamlit run chatbot/Chat.py \n",

    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "(Make sure to include the trailing forward slash)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a production environment, you might want to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Add user authentication and role-based access control\n",
    "2. **Caching**: Cache common queries and schema information to improve performance\n",
    "3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Track usage, performance, and query patterns\n",
    "4. **Customization**: Tailor the system prompts for specific manufacturing use cases\n",
    "5. **Integration**: Connect to multiple data sources within your industrial environment\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging foundation models with tool-calling capabilities, you can create powerful natural language interfaces to your industrial data systems, making data more accessible to everyone in your organization."
